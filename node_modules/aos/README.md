## ⚙ Installation

### Basic

Add styles in `<head>`:

```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/aos@next/dist/aos.css" />
```

Add script right before closing `</body>` tag, and initialize AOS:
```html
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/aos@next/dist/aos.js"></script>
=======
Small library to animate elements on your page as you scroll.

You may say it's like WOWJS, yeah - you're right, effect is similar to WOWJS, but I had a different idea how to make such a plugin, so here it is. CSS3 driven scroll animation library.

AOS allows you to animate elements as you scroll down, and up.
If you scroll back to top, elements will animate to it's previous state and are ready to animate again if you scroll down.

## ❗ Attention
From version `2.0.0` attributes `aos` are no longer supported, always use `data-aos`.

## ⚙ Setup

### Install AOS

- Using `bower`

    ```bash
      bower install aos --save
    ```

- Using `npm`

    ```bash
      npm install aos --save
    ```

- Direct download -> [click here](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos/archive/master.zip)


### Link styles

```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/aos/dist/aos.css" />
```

### Add scripts

```html
  <script src="bower_components/aos/dist/aos.js"></script>
```

AOS from version `1.2.0` is available as UMD module, so you can use it as AMD, Global, Node or ES6 module.

### Init AOS

```javascript
>>>>>>> 87efe3039d35b3a3e1df5373581bd91a94650a53
  <script>
    AOS.init();
  </script>
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Using package managers

Install `aos` package:
* `yarn add aos@next`
* or `npm install --save aos@next`

Import script, styles and initialize AOS:
```js
import AOS from 'aos';
import 'aos/dist/aos.css'; // You can also use <link> for styles
// ..
AOS.init();
```

In order to make it work you'll have to make sure your build process has configured styles loader, and bundles it all correctly.
If you're using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) however, it will work out of the box as provided.

## 🤔 How to use it?

### 1. Initialize AOS:

```js
AOS.init();

// You can also pass an optional settings object
// below listed default settings
AOS.init({
  // Global settings:
  disable: false, // accepts following values: 'phone', 'tablet', 'mobile', boolean, expression or function
  startEvent: 'DOMContentLoaded', // name of the event dispatched on the document, that AOS should initialize on
  initClassName: 'aos-init', // class applied after initialization
  animatedClassName: 'aos-animate', // class applied on animation
  useClassNames: false, // if true, will add content of `data-aos` as classes on scroll
  disableMutationObserver: false, // disables automatic mutations' detections (advanced)
  debounceDelay: 50, // the delay on debounce used while resizing window (advanced)
  throttleDelay: 99, // the delay on throttle used while scrolling the page (advanced)
  

  // Settings that can be overridden on per-element basis, by `data-aos-*` attributes:
  offset: 120, // offset (in px) from the original trigger point
  delay: 0, // values from 0 to 3000, with step 50ms
  duration: 400, // values from 0 to 3000, with step 50ms
  easing: 'ease', // default easing for AOS animations
  once: false, // whether animation should happen only once - while scrolling down
  mirror: false, // whether elements should animate out while scrolling past them
  anchorPlacement: 'top-bottom', // defines which position of the element regarding to window should trigger the animation

});
```

### 2. Set animation using `data-aos` attribute:

```html
  <div data-aos="fade-in"></div>
```

And adjust behaviour by using `data-aos-*` attributes:
```html
  <div
    data-aos="fade-up"
    data-aos-offset="200"
    data-aos-delay="50"
    data-aos-duration="1000"
    data-aos-easing="ease-in-out"
    data-aos-mirror="true"
    data-aos-once="false"
    data-aos-anchor-placement="top-center"
  >
  </div>
```

[See full list of all animations, easings and anchor placements](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos#animations)

#### Anchor

There is also a setting that can be used only on per-element basis:
* `data-aos-anchor` - element whose offset will be used to trigger animation instead of an actual one.

Examples:
```html
<div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor=".other-element"></div>
```

This way you can trigger animation on one element, while you scroll to another - useful in animating fixed elements.

---

## API
=======
## 🤔 How to use it?

### Basic usage

  All you have to do is to add `data-aos` attribute to html element, like so:

```html
  <div data-aos="animation_name">
```

  Script will trigger "animation_name" animation on this element, if you scroll to it.

  [Down below](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos#-animations) is a list of all available animations for now :)

### 🔥 Advanced settings

These settings can be set both on certain elements, or as default while initializing script (in options object without `data-` part).

| Attribute | Description | Example value | Default value |
|---------------------------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| *`data-aos-offset`* | Change offset to trigger animations sooner or later (px) | 200 | 120 |
| *`data-aos-duration`* | *Duration of animation (ms) | 600 | 400 |
| *`data-aos-easing`* | Choose timing function to ease elements in different ways | ease-in-sine | ease |
| *`data-aos-delay`* | Delay animation (ms) | 300 | 0 |
| *`data-aos-anchor`* | Anchor element, whose offset will be counted to trigger animation instead of actual elements offset | #selector | null |
| *`data-aos-anchor-placement`* | Anchor placement - which one position of element on the screen should trigger animation | top-center | top-bottom |
| *`data-aos-once`* | Choose wheter animation should fire once, or every time you scroll up/down to element | true | false |

*Duration accept values from 50 to 3000, with step 50ms, it's because duration of animation is handled by css, and to not make css longer than it is already I created implementations only in this range. I think this should be good for almost all cases.

If not, you may write simple CSS on your page that will add another duration option value available, for example:

```css
  body[data-aos-duration='4000'] [data-aos], [data-aos][data-aos][data-aos-duration='4000']{
    transition-duration: 4000ms;
  }
```

This code will add 4000ms duration available for you to set on AOS elements, or to set as global duration while initializing AOS script.

Notice that double `[data-aos][data-aos]` - it's not a mistake, it is a trick, to make individual settings more important than global, without need to write ugly "!important" there :)

`data-aos-anchor-placement` - You can set different placement option on each element, the principle is pretty simple, each anchor-placement option contains two words i.e. `top-center`. This means that animation will be triggered when `top` of element will reach `center` of the window.
`bottom-top` means that animation will be triggered when `bottom` of an element reach `top` of the window, and so on.
Down below you can find list of all anchor-placement options.

#### Examples:

```html
  <div data-aos="fade-zoom-in" data-aos-offset="200" data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine" data-aos-duration="600">
```
```html
  <div data-aos="flip-left" data-aos-delay="100" data-aos-anchor=".example-selector">
```
```html
  <div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-center">
```


#### API
>>>>>>> 87efe3039d35b3a3e1df5373581bd91a94650a53

AOS object is exposed as a global variable, for now there are three methods available:

  * `init` - initialize AOS
  * `refresh` - recalculate all offsets and positions of elements (called on window resize)
  * `refreshHard` - reinit array with AOS elements and trigger `refresh` (called on DOM changes that are related to `aos` elements)

Example execution:
```javascript
  AOS.refresh();
```

By default AOS is watching for DOM changes and if there are any new elements loaded asynchronously or when something is removed from DOM it calls `refreshHard` automatically. In browsers that don't support `MutationObserver` like IE you might need to call `AOS.refreshHard()` by yourself.

`refresh` method is called on window resize and so on, as it doesn't require to build new store with AOS elements and should be as light as possible.

## JS Events

AOS dispatches two events on document: `aos:in` and `aos:out` whenever any element animates in or out, so that you can do extra stuff in JS:
```js
document.addEventListener('aos:in', ({ detail }) => {
  console.log('animated in', detail);
});

document.addEventListener('aos:out', ({ detail }) => {
  console.log('animated out', detail);
});
```

You can also tell AOS to trigger custom event on specific element, by setting `data-aos-id` attribute:
```html
<div data-aos="fade-in" data-aos-id="super-duper"></div>
```

Then you'll be able to listen for two custom events then:
- `aos:in:super-duper`
- `aos:out:super-duper`

---

## Recipes:

#### Adding custom animations:
Sometimes built-in animations are just not enough. Let's say you need one box to have different animation depending on resolution.
Here's how you could do it:

```css
[data-aos="new-animation"] {
  opacity: 0;
  transition-property: transform, opacity;

  &.aos-animate {
    opacity: 1;
  }

  @media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
    transform: translateX(100px);

    &.aos-animate {
      transform: translateX(0);
    }
  }
}
```
Then use it in HTML:
```html
<div data-aos="new-animation"></div>
```
The element will only animate opacity on mobile devices, but from 768px width it'll also slide from right to left.

#### Adding custom easing:
Similar to animations you can add custom easings:
```css
[data-aos] {
  body[data-aos-easing="new-easing"] &,
  &[data-aos][data-aos-easing="new-easing"] {
    transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(.250, .250, .750, .750);
  }
}
```

#### Customizing default animations distance
Default distance for built-in animations is 100px. As long as you're using SCSS though, you can override it:
```css
$aos-distance: 200px; // It has to be above import
@import 'node_modules/aos/src/sass/aos.scss';
```
You have to however configure your build process to allow it to import styles from `node_modules` beforehand.

#### Integrating external CSS animation library (e.g. Animate.css):
Use `animatedClassName` to change default behaviour of AOS, to apply class names placed inside `data-aos` on scroll.

```html
<div data-aos="fadeInUp"></div>
```

```js
AOS.init({
  useClassNames: true,
  initClassName: false,
  animatedClassName: 'animated',
});
```

The above element will get two classes: `animated` and `fadeInUp`. Using different combinations of the three above settings, you should be able to integrate any external CSS animation library.

External libraries however don't care too much about animation state before the actual animation. So if you want those elements to be not visible before scrolling, you might need to add similar styles:
```css
[data-aos] {
  visibility: hidden;
}
[data-aos].animated {
  visibility: visible;
}
```

---

## Caveats:

#### setting: `duration`, `delay`

Duration and delay accept values from 50 to 3000, with step 50ms, it's because those are handled by css, and to not make css longer than it is already I implemented only a subset. I believe those should cover most cases.

If not, you can write simple CSS that will add another duration, for example:

```css
  body[data-aos-duration='4000'] [data-aos],
  [data-aos][data-aos][data-aos-duration='4000'] {
    transition-duration: 4000ms;
  }
```
This code will add 4000ms duration available for you to set on AOS elements, or to set as global duration while initializing AOS script.
Notice that double `[data-aos][data-aos]` - it's not a mistake, it is a trick, to make individual settings more important than global, without need to write ugly "!important" there :)

Example usage:
```html
  <div data-aos="fade-in" data-aos-duration="4000"></div>
```

---

## Predefined options

### Animations
=======
### Global settings

If you don't want to change setting for each element separately, you can change it globally.

To do this, pass options object to `init()` function, like so:

```javascript
  <script>
    AOS.init({
      offset: 200,
      duration: 600,
      easing: 'ease-in-sine',
      delay: 100,
    });
  </script>
```

#### Additional configuration

These settings can be set only in options object while initializing AOS.

| Setting | Description | Example value | Default value |
|---------------------------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| *`disable`* | Condition when AOS should be disabled | mobile | false |
| *`startEvent`* | Name of event, on which AOS should be initialized | exampleEvent | DOMContentLoaded |

##### Disabling AOS

If you want to disable AOS on certain device or under any statement you can set `disable` option. Like so:

```javascript
  <script>
    AOS.init({
      disable: 'mobile'
    });
  </script>
```

There are several options that you can use to fit AOS perfectly into your project, you can pass one of three device types:
`mobile` (phones and tablets), `phone` or `tablet`. This will disable AOS on those certains devices. But if you want make your own condition, simple type your statement instead of device type name:

```javascript
  disable: window.innerWidth < 1024
```

There is also posibility to pass a `function`, which should at the end return `true` or `false`:

```javascript
  disable: function () {
    var maxWidth = 1024;
    return window.innerWidth < maxWidth;
  }
```

##### Start event

If you don't want to initialize AOS on `DOMContentLoaded` event, you can pass your own event name and trigger it whenever you want. AOS is listening for this event on `document` element.

```javascript
  <script>
    AOS.init({
      startEvent: 'someCoolEvent'
    });
  </script>
```

**Important note:** If you set `startEvent: 'load'` it will add event listener on `window` instead of `document`.
